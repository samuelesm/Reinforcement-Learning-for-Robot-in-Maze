# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Robot-in-Maze

In this project, you will implement Q-learning and REINFORCE algorithms and 
learn optimal policies for some MDP environments. You will also implement 
Value Iteration or Policy Iteration algorithms for a known and simple MDP 
and see how fast your Q-learning algorithm converges to the optimal Q values. 
For all environments, the discount factor is fixed to ùõæ = 0.
